> **ENCRYPTION:** ACTIVE  
> **STABILITY:** 99.9%

## 00. OVERVIEW
MONOLITH is a bespoke, brutalist digital archive designed for high-impact visual identity. It rejects standard web patterns in favor of a "terminal-first" philosophy, utilizing a rotational navigation core and atmospheric depth layering.

## 01. DESIGN SPECIFICATIONS
The interface is built on a "monochromatic-hazard" aesthetic.
* **Typography:** Syne (Extra Bold) for primary headers; Space Mono for system data.
* **Motion:** High-inertia scroll physics and atmospheric "dust" entry transitions.
* **Layering:** Three-tier Z-index architecture (Backdrop > Navigation > UI).
